# Reinforcement-Learning-Q-table-on-Robocode
Implement reinforcement learning algorithm (Q- policy) on Robocode using Q table

The java file shows part of the code worked on in a project on Reinforcement Learning on Robocode

Robocode is a programming game, where the goal is to develop a robot battle tank to battle against other tanks in Java or .NET.
The robot battles are running in real-time and on-screen.
It has built in classes and methods which could be used to code

THe code implements Q-learning policy with a robot.
It initially starts with random moves and learns the behaviour of its opponent overtime with increasing win rate.

Q-learning is a reinforcement learning technique used in machine learning. 
The goal of Q-learning is to learn a policy, which tells an agent what action to take under what circumstances. 
It does not require a model of the environment and can handle problems with stochastic transitions and rewards, without requiring adaptations.
